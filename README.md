# Embedded-system-GAME-CNDI-eCube
This is an embedded system-based game written by ubuntu OS and designed to target eCube.

The game's topic is a bomb-dismantling game. The game will play up to a total of 10 levels, and if you remember the location of the flashing LED and enter it in order, it will move on to the next level.

Depending on the level, the input time and the number of flashing LEDs increase.

If the input time is exceeded or the button is pressed incorrectly, it fails and returns to the first level.

_**This is team project that i did in class and i only commit what i had done(game1) before**_

_**And we could get device driver of eCube from CNDI homepage**_
